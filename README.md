## Background Generator Update

Using JavaScript, you will build an interactive project that allows you to generate gradient backgrounds that update live on all types of web browsers.

- A few things have been added to this repository from the previous repository (background-generator):

1. Write code so that the color inputs match the background generated on the first-page load.

2. Display the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load.

3. BONUS: Add a random button that generates two random numbers for the color inputs.
